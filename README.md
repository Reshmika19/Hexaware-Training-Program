## **Assignments** 

This section contains my assignment-related work. Currently, I am working on the **Courier Management System**, which focuses on database interaction, control flow statements, object-oriented programming principles, and unit testing.  

### **Assignment: Courier Management System**  
The **Courier Management System** is designed to streamline the process of handling courier deliveries. The project involves:  
- Implementing **SQL** for efficient database interaction  
- Using **control flow statements, loops, arrays, and collections** for logic implementation  
- Handling **user-defined exceptions** to ensure robust error management  
- Following **object-oriented principles** with proper class structures  


## **Case Studies: Finance Management System**  

This section contains project-based learning, including case studies with complete documentation, project files, and analysis reports. The **Finance Management System** focuses on implementing **SQL, object-oriented principles, control flow statements, exception handling, and unit testing** to build a robust financial tracking solution.  

### **Case Studies : Finance Management System**  
The **Finance Management System** is designed to help users manage and track their financial transactions efficiently. The project involves:  
- **Database integration using SQL** for storing transaction records  
- **Control flow statements, loops, arrays, and collections** for logic implementation  
- **Exception handling** with user-defined exceptions for error management  
- **Object-oriented design** to ensure modular and reusable code  
- **Unit testing** for validating system functionality

  
## **Coding Challenge**  

### **E-Commerce : Key Operations Performed**
In this challenge, I performed various database operations to manage an e-commerce system efficiently. The tasks involved **updating records, retrieving specific data, filtering information using conditions, and utilizing subqueries for complex data retrieval**.  

- **Modifying product details** → Updating prices, adjusting stock levels, and managing inventory.  
- **Handling customer orders and cart items** → Ensuring efficient order processing and cart management.  
- **Extracting meaningful insights** → Analyzing customer spending patterns, identifying high-value orders, and tracking low-stock products.  
- **Utilizing subqueries** → Finding customers who haven't placed orders, identifying products not in carts, and analyzing data relationships.  

By working with these queries, I gained hands-on experience in managing e-commerce databases, **optimizing business logic**, and making **data-driven decisions** for improved system efficiency.
