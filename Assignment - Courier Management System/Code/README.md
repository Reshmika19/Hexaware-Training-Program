- Useful for understanding **core Java concepts** such as:
  - OOPs
  - Exception Handling
  - Interfaces & Abstraction
- Ideal for learning object interactions and system logic **without using a database**.

### 2Ô∏è. `CourierManagementSystem-Database-Version`
- Fully integrated with **SQL Database**.
- Uses JDBC for real-time **CRUD operations**.
- Demonstrates how to connect Java applications with external databases using:
  - `db.properties` for configuration

## Purpose

The goal of creating two versions is to help understand:
- How to manage data in-memory (Collections)
- How to transition and scale into **real-time, persistent storage** using databases.

Both versions follow clean architecture with proper package structuring, reusable services, and menu-driven console applications.
